      <h2>Pieces of Me</h2>

      <p class="album-description">
        <strong>Pieces of Me</strong> is a deeply personal album drawn directly from my own experiences, thoughts, and struggles—many of which I was still working through while writing the songs. Each track reflects a real moment, feeling, or question from my life, captured honestly without pretending I had everything figured out.
        <br><br>
        This album lives in the middle of the process. It’s about trying to understand love, mistakes, fear, and identity while still carrying the weight of them. Some songs come from clarity, others from confusion, and some from simply needing to say things out loud before I fully understood them myself.
        <br><br>
        Musically, <strong>Pieces of Me</strong> leans into raw, emotional songwriting that values honesty over perfection. The songs are meant to feel close and human, like conversations with yourself when no one else is listening.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Pieces of Me</strong> is for anyone who’s still working through their past, their choices, and their thoughts—and learning that growth doesn’t happen all at once, but piece by piece.

      <h2>10 Life Lessons</h2>

      <p class="album-description">
        <strong>10 Life Lessons</strong> is a raw, reflective album about learning the hard way and choosing to grow anyway. Each song captures moments where love, responsibility, regret, and self-awareness collide, telling the story of a man figuring life out in real time.
        <br><br>
        This album isn’t about perfection. It’s about showing up without all the answers, owning mistakes, and understanding that some lessons only come through loss, time, and scars. The songs move through relationships, fatherhood, commitment, and accountability—from the perspective of someone who’s been wrong, tried again, and kept going.
        <br><br>
        Musically, the album leans into honest, emotional songwriting with a grounded and relatable tone. These are songs meant to sit with you, not impress you.
        <br><br>
        <strong>10 Life Lessons</strong> is for anyone who’s loved deeply, failed publicly or privately, and is still trying to be better than they were before.
